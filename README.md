Okay so I hacked this project together in about ~3 days with no actual knowledge of C, so it's a complete mess -- But I'll fix it in the coming days.



Prerequisites :
First make sure you have a folder name "backgrounds" in your HOME directory.
Second make sure your hyprpaper.conf is located in the HOME/.config/hypr directory.

HOW TO USE :
run make in the directory which the make file is located.


THINGS TO FIX :
1.Currently supports only .jpeg, .jpg or .png, if your file does not end with one of these three it won't find them.
2.Currently, it'll load only 18 images in that directory so if you don't see all your images don't be surprised.
3.Make it able to search more efficiently
4.Save paths more efficiently
